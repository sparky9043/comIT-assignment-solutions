"""
Once you complete the basic system, try these challenges:

1. Add a Teacher class with attributes (teacher_id, name, subjects)
2. Add a method to calculate class average
3. Add search functionality (find students by name)
4. Add data persistence (save to and load from a file)
5. Add a report card generator
6. Add GPA calculation (4.0 scale)
7. Add attendance tracking
8. Add student schedules/timetables

# ============================================
# ANSWER KEY (For teachers)
# ============================================

"""
The complete solution is available in the tutorial document.
Students should refer to the tutorial for guidance but try to
write the code themselves first.
